INTRODUCTION (2 Slides, 2min) - Cyrill
	UAV	--> drones	--> Copters	--> Quadrocopter
								--> Hexacopter
					--> fixed wing
		--> sea vehicles
		--> land vehicles



HOW IT WORKS (6 Slides, 6min) - Cyrill
	Rotors
	Energy
	Sensors (GPS, Accelorometer)
	Automation (Regelung)
	Radio (Bedienung)
	can / can't / limits



OUR COPTER (10 Slides, 10min) - Pascal
<<<<<<< HEAD
	can (advantage of our copter):

	can (advantage of our copter)(5 min):
>>>>>>> origin/master
        beginner/intermediate kit
		gimbal
        fpv
        price-performance (ratio)
<<<<<<< HEAD
		stabilize
		accuracy
        outdoor

	can't (disadvantage of our copter):
=======
		stabilize-controller / manual mode
		accuracy (gps)
        outdoor

	can't (disadvantage of our copter)(3 min):
>>>>>>> origin/master
        out of the box
        windy
        waterproof (underwater)
		flip
		fast manouvers (because fo weigth)
        races

<<<<<<< HEAD
	limits (of quadcopter in common):
		landing
		distance (2-3 km), max 10km with special antenna
		flight duration
=======
	limits (of quadcopter in common)(2 min):
        Control
		landing
		distance (2-3 km), max 10km with special antenna
		flight duration (gas, electrical)
>>>>>>> origin/master
		charge time
		upgradeability
        Law (flight zones, registration, ...)
