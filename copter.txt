INTRODUCTION (2 Slides, 2min) - Cyrill
	UAV	--> drones	--> Copters	--> Quadrocopter
								--> Hexacopter
					--> fixed wing
		--> sea vehicles
		--> land vehicles



HOW IT WORKS (6 Slides, 6min) - Cyrill
	Rotors
	Energy
	Sensors (GPS, Accelorometer)
	Automation (Regelung)
	Radio (Bedienung)
	can / can't / limits



OUR COPTER (10 Slides, 10min) - Pascal
	can (advantage of our copter)(5 min):
        beginner/intermediate kit
		gimbal
        fpv
        price-performance (ratio)
		stabilize-controller / manual mode
		accuracy (gps)
        outdoor

	can't (disadvantage of our copter)(3 min):
        out of the box
        windy
        waterproof (underwater)
		flip
		fast manouvers (because fo weigth)
        races

	limits (of quadcopter in common)(2 min):
        Control
		landing
		distance (2-3 km), max 10km with special antenna
		flight duration (gas, electrical)
		charge time
		upgradeability
        Law (flight zones, registration, ...)




USAGE (4 Slides, 4min) - Pascal
	personal
		photography
        

	professional
        test stabilize controller
        cheap version of a quad




OUTLOOK (4 Slides, 4min) - Cyrill
	current time
	future (amazo packages)
	upgrades
    sources / Links

	current time:
	privacy problem --> many and cheap drones with camera
	drones near the airport --can damage the plain

	future:
	rescue drones
	package delivery (amazon)

	upgrades:
	drones can carry diffrent things and adapters for camera and otherthings.
